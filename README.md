# VarGFaceNet Pytorch Implementation with AdaFace for LRFR
In this work, we developed a lightweight face recognition model for low-resolution face images with VarGFaceNet architecture and adaptive margin loss AdaFace. This work also use super resolution model such as Real-ESRGAN and GFP-GAN to eliminate degradation in low-resolution images and reconstruct poses and facial expressions.
